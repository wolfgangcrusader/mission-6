      "description": "This gorgeous home has a lot to offer. Nestled in lush native bush, you can relax and unwind on the expansive deck space and watch the bird life. Very private and quiet setting, ideal for those who love nature.  The house has just undergone a full interior repaint, brand new carpet and hard flooring throughout as well as a full deck replacement.  The home has three bedrooms upstairs with the master being a very generous size. There is a main family bathroom with a bath and the master has an ensuite.  Downstairs you have a study (big enough to be used as a fourth bedroom but this space has no wardrobe) which leads out onto the large deck area.  A large living space and dining leads to the kitchen and a further dining or a family area. A separate laundry with another toilet makes this home spacious and flexible.  Ideal location only a short walk to Birkenhead shopping centre where you will find an abundance of cafes and restaurants. Handy to schools and on a bus routine for an easy commute to the CBD.
